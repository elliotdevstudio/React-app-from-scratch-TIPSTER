React-from-scratch--Tipster-

A react project without use of create-react-app that serves as a gratuity disbursement calculator for businesses and their employees. This is currently a minimal foundation for beginning development, but the idea and functionality of is already built out and established in a private spreadsheet that contains all the necessary components. The goal of this application is to assist in the day to day calculation of gratuities that are collected and shared between employees in service industry businesses-- this is a challenging problem for both business and workers, in that it can be highly impactful on workplace culture and sense of fairness. I've worked in this industry for many years and know first-hand how complicated this is. Opinions about this are all over the place, which is why it creates tension and animosity. At the very least, this application will create transparency and provide the information needed for management to make data-driven decisions about how gratuities can be fairly distributed in order to create a more balanced and equitable system for all their hard workers.

IDEAS FOR THE BUILD

I'll start by establishing a few functional components to serve as a single page application, where state will update in components downstream from where the user adds information. The final totals and percentages will be calculated and presented to the user. Once this stage is completed, there will be a backend added to collect and store the daily reports, most likely through a noSQL database, and from there a handful of queries will be added to provide the user with different sets of numbers that could be used with other sales and payroll reporting to make financial reconciliation easier. 

HOPEFULLY IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE

This application could be integrtated with existing payroll systems for even greater ease of use-- more to come on that front as this application is further developed.
