React-from-scratch--Tipster-

A react project without use of create-react-app that serves as a gratuity disbursement calculator for businesses and their employees. This project is currently in a very early stage of development, but the idea and functionality of this application is already built and established in a private spreadsheet that contains all the necessary components. The goal of this application is to assist in the day to day calculation of gratuities that are collected and shared between employees in service industry businesses-- this is a challenging problem for both business and workers, in that it can be highly impactful on workplace culture, satisfaction, and sense of fairness. I've worked in this industry for many years and know first-hand how complicated this is. With personal opinions often being across the spectrum on how tips should be shared, which can create tension and animosity if not appropriately addressed, this application will create transparency and provide the information needed for management to make data-driven decisions, in order to create a more balanced and equitable disbursement system for all their hard workers.

IDEAS FOR THE BUILD

The build out of this will start with establishing some functional components as a single page application, where state will be updated only for those which require it as further information is added. The calculations will cascade across a number of the components that will ultimately display the final totals and percentages to the user. Once this stage is completed, there will be a backend added to collect and store the daily reports, with queries added to provide the user with daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly reports.

HOPEFULLY IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE

This application could be integrtated with existing payroll systems for even greater ease of use-- more to come on that front as this application is further developed.
